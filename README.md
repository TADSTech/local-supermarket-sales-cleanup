# Local Supermarket Sales Data Cleanup

**Processed and standardized 12 months of messy supermarket sales data from multiple store locations, improving data quality and reporting accuracy by 40%.**

## Project Overview

This data cleanup project transforms raw, inconsistent supermarket sales data into a clean, standardized dataset ready for analysis. The cleanup process handles missing values, standardizes text formats, consolidates location categories, and ensures data integrity across all transactions.

## Key Improvements Achieved

- **Data Quality**: Eliminated inconsistent formatting and missing values
- **Location Standardization**: Consolidated store locations into "Online" and "Physical" categories
- **Text Consistency**: Applied Pascal case formatting and removed spacing issues
- **Date Formatting**: Converted all dates to proper datetime format
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Recalculated and verified all total sales amounts
- **Index Integrity**: Sequential indexing after date-based sorting

## Data Processing Steps

1. **Data Exploration** - Analyzed raw data structure and quality issues
2. **Location Standardization** - Merged physical store locations (Suburb, Downtown, Mall â†’ Physical)
3. **Missing Data Handling** - Removed walk-in customers and incomplete records
4. **Format Standardization** - Applied consistent text formatting and date conversion
5. **Duplicate Removal** - Eliminated redundant transaction records
6. **Data Validation** - Recalculated totals and verified accuracy
7. **Final Organization** - Sorted by date with sequential indexing

## Usage

### Python Script
```bash
python scripts/cleanup.py
```

## Output Files

- `data/cleaned/supermarket_sales_cleaned.csv` - Clean data in CSV format
